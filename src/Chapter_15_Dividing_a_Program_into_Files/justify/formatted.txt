C is quirky,  flawed,  and  an  enormous  success.  Although
accidents of history surely helped, it evidently satisfied a
need for a system implementation language  efficient  enough
to displace assembly language. Yet sufficiently abstract and
fluent to describe algorithms and  interactions  in  a  wide
wariety of environments. -- Dennis M. Ritchie
